> Trevor and I are in our early 20's.
We want to travel Europe with nothing more than what we can carry on our backs.
We want to work remotely on whatever work we can find, with a focus on building
websites and online applications.
We want to start in August, 2015.

It's very difficult to start doing anything. The bigger picture of where you'd
like your life to be is easy to imagine, but whittling it down into small,
malleable iterations is daunting. You know what you want, you have the tools to
get there, yet even when you sit down and _really_ try to start working, it's
easy to put it off for another day.

This is the reason why many people don't follow through with goals in their
lives. Momentum has a starting velocity of zero, and getting the ball rolling,
especially in the beginning, takes a lot of effort and willingness to make
mistakes along the way.

For the past few weeks, I've been meeting with Trevor Waldorf to discuss our
plans to travel to Europe together. Our usual spot is a rather pretentious
coffee shop a few blocks away from my apartment in Boulder, Colorado that we've
grown a strong attachment to. The idea of us dropping everything and just
leaving with nothing but a 20 pound backpack resembled more of an imaginary
dream when it was first mentioned. Only recently has it developed into not only
something feasible, but a true desire spearheaded by our craving for
perspective.

We wanted to start writing about our mission from the very beginning, but as
noted above, it's tough to form new habits, and I for one had never freely
written anything before last week. I think a part of the hesitation is from our
own minds falsly pretecting us from unreasonable downfalls.

_Is this going to be worth my time?_

_What if I mess up and someone sees?_

_What if plans fall through and I look like a failure?_

From an early age, society has embedded in us the intense fear of doing
something wrong or frowned upon. In his video on the
[Science of Awkwardness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o268qbb_0BM), Michael
Stevens of Vsauce discusses what he calls "the family of forces that
guide social behavior". Past the obvious limits of science (you can't be in two
places at once, you can't wear pants made of molten lead, etc.), past the laws
of the state that delineate rules enfored by governmental authority, and past
even the smaller set of proper social etiquette, there lies each person's unique
self-consciousness that guides our actions.

This personal apprehension grows with us, quietly shaping who we are and how we
believe the world sees us. We build skepticism and legislate our own agendas. We
spend a great deal of time worrying about others and what they may think of us
should we dissappoint them. Behind the scenes lies our constant worry of not
being successful. Not being happy. The hard and unintuitive truth is that
