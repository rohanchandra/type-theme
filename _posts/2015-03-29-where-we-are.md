> Trevor and I are in our early 20's.
We're getting ready to travel Europe with nothing more than what we can carry on our backs.
We're sustaining our lifestyle by working remotely on whatever we can find, with a focus on designing and
developing websites and online applications. We leave the U.S. and everything we know in August, 2015.

It's very difficult to start doing anything. The bigger picture of where you'd
like your life to be is easy to imagine, but whittling it down into small,
malleable iterations is daunting. You know what you want, you have the tools to
get there, yet even when you sit down and _really_ try to start working, it's
easy to put it off for another day.

This is the reason why many people don't follow through with goals in their
lives. Momentum has a starting velocity of zero, and getting the ball rolling,
especially in the beginning, takes a lot of effort and willingness to make
mistakes along the way.

For the past few weeks, I've been meeting with Trevor Waldorf to discuss our
plans to travel to Europe together. Our usual spot is a rather pretentious
coffee shop a few blocks away from my apartment in Boulder, Colorado that we've
grown a strong attachment to. The idea of us dropping everything and just
leaving with nothing but a 20 pound backpack resembled more of an imaginary
dream when it was first mentioned. Only recently has it developed into not only
something feasible, but a true desire spearheaded by our craving for
perspective.

We wanted to start writing about our mission from the very beginning, but as
noted above, it's tough to form new habits, and I had never freely
written about anything before last week. I think a part of the hesitation stems
from our own minds falsely protecting us from unreasonable downfalls.

_Is this going to be worth my time?_

_What if I mess up and someone sees?_

_What if plans fall through and I look like a complete failure?_

From an early age, society has embedded in us the intense fear of doing
something wrong or frowned upon. In his video on the
[Science of Awkwardness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o268qbb_0BM), Michael
Stevens of Vsauce discusses what he calls "the family of forces that
guide social behavior". Past the obvious limits of science (you can't be in two
places at once, you can't wear pants made of molten lead, etc.), past the laws
of the state that delineate rules enforced by governmental authority, and past
the even smaller set of proper social etiquette, there lies each person's unique
self-consciousness that guides our daily actions.

This personal apprehension grows with us, quietly shaping who we are and how we
believe the world sees us. We build skepticism and legislate our own agendas. We
spend a great deal of time worrying about others and what they may think of us.
Many people share a common anxiety called "imposter syndrome", the
feeling that all of your goals and life accomplishments have been based on
other's work and that you really have no idea what you're doing. And no
one wants any of this to seep through the cracks and into their public life. We
want to seem confident and lucrative, and any accidents or mistakes we make are
quickly swept under the rug and proclaimed a fluke in our otherwise normal
existence.

This is of course, __complete bullshit__.

The unintuitive truth is that the mistakes in our lives are far more valuable
than the successes. I'm not talking about the "_let's find out what meth is
like_" kind of mistakes, but rather the missteps we make when trying to achieve
something new, to build ourselves up as better beings. A popular (possibly
overused) phrase in the startup community is to "Fail early and fail often".
The first time I heard this was in my introductory computer science course at CU
Boulder by a brilliant man named [Gabe Johnson](http://six11.org/).

I figured he was crazy.

_How can anyone think they will get ahead in life if they are constantly
failing?_

School was gauging my intelligence based on grades, I didn't have time to sit
around and fail. I was 18 then, and I held that mentality for the next two
years. Only within the last year did I really understand what the phrase truly
was getting at. The purpose is not to go out and try to fail, that will happen
regardless (just talk to any entrepreneur). The point is that you will have no
idea what will work and what won't until you try. The more you do this the more
you will fail, but your failure rate will slowly decrease as you adapt to the
successes.

Trevor and I are very young. We have no reason _not_ to take as many chances as
possible. We are baggage free; no spouses, no kids, no home or car mortgages, no
pets, absolutely nothing to hold us back but our own fear of failure.

These weekly posts will help to benchmark our busy thoughts and carve them into
coherent ideas that we can share with others. They will also help us plan out
what we really want from a trip that will last indefinitely. Some of the writing
we do may be god awful, but we aren't going to learn how to correct those
aberrations until we know how to find them.

Our plans are still very raw and unrefined. We are gathering as many opinions
and perspectives as possible, from anyone who would like to share. Each week, we
write about what new knowledge we've gained. The point of writing these
posts in a serial fashion is to expose our mistakes and ignorance. We want
others to be able to follow our thought patterns, not just hear about our
solutions after the struggle is over.
