title: On Austin
---

Austin makes me laugh. If you hang around people who make you laugh, you'll live longer. You'll live better, too, because laughing is maybe the best thing.

I don't know much about him, but I know he's from around here, and he wants to be elsewhere. I know we're both mediocre at foosball and have a great time playing 1v1 on a 2v2 table. What more do you need in a travel partner than wanderlust and foosball?

Being detail-oriented is important for people that make things for other people, as both Austin and I do. Sometimes Austin takes that trait too far, but he balances it well with an intense focus on shipping and making steps with the final product and experience in mind. That's an effective combination.

Maybe most importantly, Austin strikes me as transparent. I haven't ever felt the need to consider his intent or his motivations.

On the flip side of this transparency, he lacks outward confidence in his abilities and their trajectories (he's easily in the top 1% of computer users on the planet, and is quickly building one of the most difficult skill sets of the 21st century).

I think this travel thing will be a lot of fun.
