Stargazing by yourself is romantic. We should always be to romancing ourselves.

It's All In The Pitch

I'm undercharging by about ten thousand dollars. That's not a good feeling.

How we got here

Pitching is explaining your ideas and decisions in an engaging way.

When you pitch, you are asking your audience to adopt your ideas. Your ideas may be at odds with the ideas they hold.

An audience will welcome your ideas into their home happily after a good pitch.

Many creatives don't understand what their audience loves about their work. A painting looks different to a painter than to an office manager. A CTO thinks about an app differently from her CFO.

When you pitch, try to see what your audience sees. Your pitch will be more effective the closer you align your vision with your audience's.

Break down basic decisions. Choices we make on instinct may never occur to those we are pitching. Designers fail to explain basic decisions that can keep a project focused because they _feel natural_ to the designer. Developers are frustrated when they push clever code and everyone compliments them on the new button styling.

If you feel you're overselling/overcharging, you have probably forgotten (or don't know) the inherent value in yourself or the good decisions you make early in your work. Use the pitch as an opportunity to explain, and you might recognize just how beast you are.
