title: Github is Gandalf

I grew up using “high” technology to escape. Building computers and going to LAN parties brought me to new worlds, filled with the fantastic and exciting. The icy peaks of Icewind Dale, then later building those peaks in SDKs and writing scripts in LUA captivated me like nothing else in life (with the possible exception of a good capture-the-flag match on the beach).

Family trips in the pristine beauty and isolation of the Alaskan wilderness would find me huddled in a tent, drawing plans for new game mods or thinking with envy of my internet friends playing Team Fortress while I was slightly damp and covered in bug bites. My best memories from childhood are a mixup of playing in the wild beauty of the Alaskan coast and competing for world records in online games.

After I left Alaska, a switch flipped. The role of computers, the internet, and high tech in my life transformed from representing _other_ worlds to becoming a gateway into and a toolkit for exploring our own, Earth.

Now Austin and I are taking that a step further. By leveraging the tools of development and design, we’re using our skills in technology to see other parts of the world. We’re leaving the Shire, but instead of Gandalf we have Github.

__Technology is for discovering the world, not escaping it.__
