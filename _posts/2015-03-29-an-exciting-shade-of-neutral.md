title: An Exciting Shade of Neutral
---

I live a very well-off life, and I always have. Never once have I had to worry
about where I would sleep, what I would eat, or how I would obtain an education.

All of this is a good thing. This means that my parents could provide a life
equal if not better than their own. It means I was not only lucky enough to be
part of the 4.5% of humans in the United States, but that I was raised in an
extremely safe and profitable demographic, allowing me to grow up without a care
in the world. But it also means my perception of diversity and culture, or how
the rest of the world works, is considerably subpar.

It's easy to get comfortable with your surroundings when you stay in one place
most of your life.
