My wife was complaining about the constant private messages she was getting on LinkedIn from creepy men wanting to use the site as if it were a dating site and not a site for profressionals to connect.

In the past I have blogged about particular individuals (like [David Stewart](http://tosbourn.com/david-stewart-marketing-digital-solutions-thinks-ok-creep-females-linkedin/)) who think it is OK to creep on ladies but
other people have since contacted me with similar stories and screen grabs.

I thought I would make a space were people could call out these idiots.

I imagine that the vast majority of the victims in these situations are going to be women, and as of writing this about page the posts have been exclusively from women but that isn't to say I wouldn't publish something 
a man shared that he felt was inappropriate â€“ Assholery is assholery.
