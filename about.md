My wife was complaining about the constant private messages she was getting on LinkedIn from creepy men wanting to use the site as if it were a dating site and not a site for profressionals connect.

In the past I have blogged about particular individuals (like [David Stewart](http://tosbourn.com/david-stewart-marketing-digital-solutions-thinks-ok-creep-females-linkedin/)) who think it is OK to creep on ladies but
other people have since contacted me with similar stories and screengrabs.

I thought I would make a space were people could call out these idiots.
