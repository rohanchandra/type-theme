This is Angus Gordon's personal blog. I'm a Melburnian who's interested in cities, literature, film, TV, opera, pop music, and politics.

Between 2003 and 2008 I had a blog called I feel love, which is lovingly preserved [at archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20080513213306/http://angusg.typepad.com/blog).

In my professional life, I'm a content strategist at an agency called Weave. I blog about content strategy on our [company blog](http://weaveweb.com.au).
